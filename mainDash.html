                <h3>About This Plant</h3>
                <p>
                    <b>Water:</b> These plants prefer moist soil and never like to dry out. If drying out does occur,
                    you'll notice some wilting. Water them immediately and the plant should recover within the day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Light:</b> This plant will thrive in a bright, filtered light as well as under artificial lights indoors.
                    This plant can handle brief periods of bright and intense sunlight, but should not be exposed for
                    prolonged amount of time.
                </p>
                <p><b>Soil:</b> As a houseplant, any commercial poitting soil will be suitable for pilea baby tears.</p>
                <p>
                    <b>Temperature and Humidity:</b> Baby Tears enjoy temperatures that are within the 50 to 70 degree Fahrenheit
                    range and appreciate a high level of humidity. These plants work best in bathrooms or kitchens for their moist environments.
                    In drier conditions, this plant best thrives in the confines of a terrarium.
